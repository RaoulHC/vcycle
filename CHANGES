==================== Changes in Vcycle version 0.3.0 =====================
- Separate [tenancy ...] and [vmtype ...] sections in vcycle.conf
- Handle multiple vmtypes per tenancy
- Per-tenancy user_data directories, containing per-vmtype user_data files
- Use "ROT-1" encoding for passwords in config to avoid accidental 
  disclosure if browsing around. Obviously this is trivial to get around
  if one wants to.
- Allow connections to unauthenticated HTTPS servers for now
- Proper cleanup of old machine directories
- Target shares for vmtypes within tenancies
- Add vcycle_space by analogy with vac_space in tenancies
- createdThisCycle becomes creationsThisCycle to track attempts not just
  successes in case all creations always fail
- Remove JSON files from httpd

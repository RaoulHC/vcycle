==================== Changes in Vcycle version 0.3.0 =====================
- Separate [tenancy ...] and [vmtype ...] sections in vcycle.conf
- Handle multiple vmtypes per tenancy
- Use ROT-13 encoding for passwords in config to avoid accidental 
  disclosure if browsing around. Obviously this is trivial to get around
  if one wants to.
